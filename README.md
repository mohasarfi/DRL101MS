# Project Summary
Let's give robots a little bit of our intelligence
## Main Goal

This repository is a step-by-step guide designed to make Deep Reinforcement Learning concepts more tangible! We'll achieve this by building intelligent decision-making strategies for a mobile robot.

During my own DRL learning journey, I discovered fantastic online resources that helped me understand the fundamentals.  This repository takes inspiration from those resources, with the goal of implementing these algorithms in a way that makes the learning process easier and reduces code complexity. The provided Jupyter Notebook files are packed with detailed explanations and visualizations to ensure everything is clear. Heads up! This repository is written with a control/robotics background. We will bridge the gap between robotics and DRL by implementing algorithms on a simulated robot ;D



This series wouldn't be possible without all the resources from which I learnt and that I actively consulted myself. In fact, there is very little novelty in this repository! My only hope is that this step by step guide of building up algorithms and theory from first principles and ground up will help more people to approach Deep RL in a practical way. Below you find all the resources that effectively contributed to this material. The algorithms implemented in these lectures are optimized for learning. They retain the spirit and details of the real algorithms, but avoid any unnecessary code complexity for improving performance (e.g., move tensors between GPU and CPU, etc.).
