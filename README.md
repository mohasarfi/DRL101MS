# Project Summary
Let's give robots a little bit of our intelligence
## Main Goal
This repository is a step-by-step guide designed to make Deep Reinforcement Learning concepts more tangible. We'll achieve this by building  intelligent decision-making strategies for a mobile robot! The provided files are packed with detailed explanations and visualizations to ensure everything is clear. Heads up! This repository is written with a control/robotics background in mind.  ;D
