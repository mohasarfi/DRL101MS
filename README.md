# DRL 101 
Let's give robots a little bit of our intelligence

## Main Goal
Design, Visulaziation and Understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms

This repository is a step-by-step guide designed to make Deep Reinforcement Learning concepts more tangible! We'll achieve this by building intelligent decision-making strategies for a mobile robot.

During my own DRL learning journey, I discovered fantastic online resources that helped me understand the fundamentals.  This repository takes inspiration from those resources, with the goal of implementing these algorithms in a way that makes the learning process easier and reduces code complexity. The provided Jupyter Notebook files are packed with detailed explanations and visualizations to ensure everything is clear. Heads up! This repository is written with a control/robotics background. We will bridge the gap between robotics and DRL by implementing algorithms on a simulated robot ;DÏ€

** Currently, I'm focusing on the correct implementation and clear visualization of each algorithm. To achieve this, I'm usingewell-known simulation environments. As soon as I'm sure about every single detail, I will be integrating these algorithms with a real-world 2D mobile robot simulation environment!
